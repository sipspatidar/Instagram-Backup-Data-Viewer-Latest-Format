# Instagram-Backup-Data-Viewer-Latest-Format
To view the download backup data(message) of instagram

To make a backup of instagram chat is very difficult task for people. Some use screenshots, some will record screen with scrolling chat message or some some lost all the hopes. But there is a simple way to download all your instagram account information including chat messages. For More information just visit [here!](https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920). But the problem with this downloaded data is files are in json format which is not user friendly to read for normal user. So to view all your messages in user friendly way I have create a script which will load and show your backup messages in a UI like instagram. 

## Steps to use
* First Extract the .zip file that you have download from instagram
* Copy messages folder and profile.json file from your backup data and paste it into downloaded git repo folder
* Execute "script to create single msg file.py" using python
* Open index.html file in your browser and enjoy :sunglasses:.

Always happy to help you :smiley:.
